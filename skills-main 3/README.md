# OpenRouter Skills

A collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) for building with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) — a unified API for [600+ AI models](https://openrouter.ai/models).

## Installing

These skills work with any agent that supports the Agent Skills standard, including Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, OpenAI Codex, and Pi.

For agents that support plugins, installing via the native plugin system is recommended as skills will auto-update.

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add OpenRouterTeam/skills
/plugin install openrouter@openrouter
```

### Cursor

Add via **Settings > Rules > Add Rule > Remote Rule (Github)** with `OpenRouterTeam/skills`.

### OpenCode

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenRouterTeam/skills.git /tmp/openrouter-skills
cp -r /tmp/openrouter-skills/skills/* ~/.config/opencode/skills/
rm -rf /tmp/openrouter-skills
```

### Skills CLI

Works with any supported agent ([docs](https://skills.sh/docs/cli)):

```
npx skills add OpenRouterTeam/skills
```

## Skills

Skills are contextual and auto-loaded based on your conversation. When a request matches a skill's triggers, the agent loads and applies the relevant skill to provide accurate, up-to-date guidance.
