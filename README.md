OpenClawd is the public monorepo behind the 🦞 Clawd ecosystem — an orchestrator, model router, wallet tooling, x402/AP2 payment rails, MCP servers, browser surfaces, package libraries, edge workers, and a large checked-in skill and agent catalog so teams can fork one repo and ship chain-native AI products quickly.

## Flagship Capabilities

- **OpenClawd Orchestrator** in [`openclawd-stack/`](./openclawd-stack/) ties together wallets, Honcho memory, E2B sandboxes, MCP tools, and monetized runtime services.
- **ClawdRouter** in [`clawdrouter/`](./clawdrouter/) routes across cloud and local models, supports hosted and local AI lanes, and sits on the payment-aware edge of the stack.
- **Browser automation and pAGENT** in [`chrome-extension/`](./chrome-extension/) gives the stack a browser-native operator surface for wallet-aware browsing, tool use, and task automation.
- **50-agent catalog and bundled skills** live in [`AGENTS/`](./AGENTS/) and [`skills/`](./skills/), giving the repo a ready-made marketplace and extension layer.
- **Payments as a first-class primitive** span x402, MPP, AP2, and A2A flows; see [ARTICLE_PAYMENTS.md](./docs/articles/ARTICLE_PAYMENTS.md).
- **Local AI and remote tunnel flows** are documented in [ARTICLE_LOCAL_AI.md](./docs/articles/ARTICLE_LOCAL_AI.md) and [CLAWD_ROUTER_TUNNEL.md](./docs/articles/CLAWD_ROUTER_TUNNEL.md).
- **AutoResearch and agentic research loops** are documented in [AUTO_RESEARCH_AGENTS.md](./docs/articles/AUTO_RESEARCH_AGENTS.md).
- **ClawdVault security posture** is described in [SECURITY_VAULT_INTEGRATION.md](./SECURITY_VAULT_INTEGRATION.md) and the [`skills/clawd-vault/`](./skills/clawd-vault/) + [`MCP/vault-mcp/`](./MCP/vault-mcp/) implementation.
- **Agent Bus / Claw3D integration** is covered in [agent-bus.md](./docs/articles/agent-bus.md).
- **⛓️ Solana Attestation Service (SAS)** in [`skills/solana-attestation-skill/`](./skills/solana-attestation-skill/) enables formally verified, on-chain attestations for skills via QEDGen Lean 4 proofs.
- **Formally Verified Skills** integrate QEDGen formal verification with on-chain attestation storage using the Solana Attestation Service program.
- **Metaplex Agent Integration** with vault-protected wallets at birth - agents mint as MPL Core NFTs with attestation metadata.
- **Hermès Vault Protocol** - agent wallets are initialized in vault custody at birth for secure multi-signature operations.

## Quick Start

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/x402agent/openclawd.git
cd openclawd
cp .env.example .env

# Install repo-managed hooks and verify the machine.
npm run hooks:install
npm run doctor

# Install the main repo entry points.
npm run install:all

# Build the agent catalog and start the orchestrator.
npm run build:catalog
npm run dev:orchestrator
```

Minimum local toolchain:

- Node `20+`
- npm `10+`
- `pnpm` on your `PATH`
- Git

### Bootstrap Installer

If you want the end-user bootstrap flow instead of a full source checkout:

```bash
bash ./install.sh
```

Install snippets and hosted installer copy live in [INSTALL_SNIPPETS.md](./INSTALL_SNIPPETS.md).

## Core Developer Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run hooks:install` | Installs repo-managed git hooks to block accidental secret commits |
| `npm run brand:check` | Catches high-visibility old-brand phrases in first-party docs |
| `npm run doctor` | Verifies the supported root bootstrap path |
| `npm run guard:worktree` | Scans tracked and untracked worktree files for env files and common secret patterns |
| `npm run release:check` | Public-release sanity check for docs, tracked file hygiene, and package metadata |
| `npm run build:catalog` | Rebuilds the checked-in agent catalog |
| `npm run dev:orchestrator` | Starts the main runtime orchestrator from `openclawd-stack/` |
| `npm run dev:router` | Starts ClawdRouter |
| `npm run dev:registrar` | Starts the API registrar |
| `npm run dev:cli` | Starts the canonical Clawd CLI surface |

## Security Guardrails

OpenClawd is meant to be cloned and published publicly, so the repo now ships with built-in guardrails:

```bash
npm run hooks:install
npm run brand:check
npm run guard:worktree
npm run doctor
npm run release:check
```

What these cover:

- pre-commit blocks staged `.env`, `.pem`, `.key`, and common live-secret patterns
- pre-push re-runs worktree and release hygiene checks
- `brand:check` catches high-visibility first-party branding drift in docs
- `doctor` verifies the supported root bootstrap path
- `release:check` verifies public-release hygiene and metadata

Review [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) before publishing a fork or opening a release PR.
